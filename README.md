# Kafka-Contract-Enforcement-Through-Schema-Registry
This is a group of repos 
- Schema definition
- Kafka Producer using schema registry
- Kafka Consumer using schema registry

In any production grade application, it is very important for the given Kafka Producer
and Consumer to honor the agreed contract.

But what happens if either Producer / Consumer breaches that without the knowledge of the other party?
It can lead to production issues.

Do we have any way to enforce the contract?
**Schema Registry** is the answer

In this repo we have code related to schema definition, kafka producer, kafka consumer using that schema definition.

Schema Registry uses -
- Enforcing Data Contracts
- Schema Evolution
- Compatibility Checks

Happy Coding!!!
